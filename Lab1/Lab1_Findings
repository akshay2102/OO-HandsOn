The project contains a class named Account which manages a user's bank account.
It stores the following data: 
- AccNo
- Name
- Balance

There are 2 manager classes AccManager1 and AccManager2 which access the Account class to store and retrieve the account 
details for the same account. But implementation of both these manager classes are different.

The AccManager1 class accesses the data members of the Account class directly without using methods for the same. This violates
the encapsulation property of Object Oriented Programming. On the other hand AccManager2 class accesses the account information 
through the getter and setter methods of data members which is the proper way.

Output Generated: 

Performing Account Transactions using AccManager1...
AccNo : 004701
Name : Chandra
Balance : 45000.0
Performing Account Transactions using AccManager2...
AccNo : ICI004701
Name : Chandra
Balance : 48825.0

As we can see there are some errors in the information displayed by AccManager1 like AccNo doesn't have the bank code 'ICI' in it making it 
an invalid account number. Also, the balance is not displayed correctly as getter method of balance also adds the interest value to it but manager 1
is accessing the variable directly making it an incorrect and erroneous balance. My suggestion would be to make the data members of Account class 
private so outside world can only access them through the getter and setter methods defined in the Class. 
Thus, AccManager2's implementation is correct according to the principles of Object Oriented Programming.
